# Investments Portfolio App (In Progress)

## Overview
This project is a personal **Investments Portfolio App** designed to help users manage and track their fund allocations, deposits, and overall portfolio performance.  
It is still **in progress** and will continue to evolve as I add new features.

## Features
- **Portfolio Allocation**  
  Users can select funds and allocate percentages that always sum to 100%.

- **Deposit Logging**  
  Users can log deposits with dates and specify which funds were bought. Percentages update automatically.

- **Fund Data Integration**  
  Planned integration with external APIs to fetch and update real-time fund data.

- **Containerized Services**  
  The app is fully Dockerized for reproducibility and easy deployment.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)  
- **Frontend:** React  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Containerization:** Docker + docker-compose  

## Status

Upcoming improvements include:

- Enhanced portfolio visualization (charts, graphs)
